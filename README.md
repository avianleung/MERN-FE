# README for MERN-FE (Frontend)

## Introduction
Welcome to the MERN-FE app! This is the frontend part of a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack application. It's built using React and interacts with the backend server.

## Prerequisites
Before you get started, ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. If not, follow the instructions below to install it.

### Installing Node.js
1. Visit the [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Download the installer for your operating system.
3. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
4. To verify the installation, open a terminal and run `node -v`. This should return the Node.js version.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Open a terminal.
   - Navigate into the directory you want to download the codebase into by running `cd <path to your directory>`.
   - Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/avianleung/MERN-FE.git`.
   - Change to the directory with `cd MERN-FE`.

2. **Install Dependencies**
   - Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies for the frontend.

## Running the Application
- Execute `npm start` to start the frontend application.
- This will launch the React app in development mode, and it should automatically open in your default web browser.

## Additional Notes
- Make sure the backend server is running to interact with the frontend correctly.
- Check the backend repository for instructions on setting up and running the server.
